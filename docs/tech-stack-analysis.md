# Tech Stack Analysis - Rimac Frontend Challenge

## Overview
This document defines the technology stack for the Rimac Frontend Challenge, focusing on modern React development with TypeScript, type-safe API integration, and scalable architecture.

## Core Technology Stack

### 1. Build Tool & Development
**Vite + TypeScript**
- Lightning-fast development server
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Optimized production builds
- Integrated testing with Vitest

### 2. Frontend Framework
**React 18 + TypeScript**
- Functional components with hooks
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Modern React patterns (Suspense, Concurrent Features)

### 3. Styling
**Sass + BEM Methodology**
- Component-scoped styling
- Maintainable CSS architecture
- Responsive design patterns
- CSS custom properties for theming

### 4. API Integration
**ts-rest + Zod**
- Type-safe API contracts
- Runtime validation
- Shared types between client and server
- Contract-first development approach

### 5. State Management
**React Tools Context + State and if needed Reducers**
- Simple global state management
- Type-safe state updates
- Predictable state flow
- No external dependencies
- In just some specific cases redux or some additional state management tools would be needed but for the scope of this project this don't seems to be the case

### 6. Testing
**Vitest + React Testing Library**
- Fast unit testing
- Component integration testing
- Mock service worker for API mocking
- 80%+ test coverage target
- Considered Selenium for end-to-end testing, depends on time availibity

### 7. Code Format & Workflow Tools
**ESLint + Prettier + Husky**
- Code quality enforcement and linting
- Automated code formatting
- Git hooks for pre-commit validation
- Consistent code style across the project

## API Strategy with ts-rest

### Contract Definition
- Define API contracts using ts-rest
- Use Zod for runtime validation
- Share contracts between frontend and backend
- Type-safe request/response handling

### Benefits
- End-to-end type safety
- Automatic API client generation
- Runtime validation of API responses
- Reduced API integration bugs
- Better developer experience
